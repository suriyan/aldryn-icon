aldryn-icon
===========

Plugin that allows to define Icons in the CMS (works with djangocms-text-ckeditor).


Styles should be defined like in aldryn-style (https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-style):
```ALDRYN_STYLE_CLASS_NAMES = (
    ('info', _("info")),
    ('new', _("new")),
    ('hint', _("hint")),
)```
